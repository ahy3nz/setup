The following files are needed for running a gel simulation with GROMACS 

gel.gro  input coordinate file 
gel.mdp  input parameters 
LipCholHydCarbFF.itp force field parameters
gel.top topology file that tells how many waters and lipids there are
         and includes the force field parameters from LipCholHydCarbFF.itp 

Running the simulations with other programs  will require suitable 
reformatting of the data in these files.
